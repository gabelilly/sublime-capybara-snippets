sublime-capybara-snippets
=========================

A group of snippets used in Sublime Text 2/3 when working with Capybara/Rspec for acceptance test automation. These are based on another repo, but addapted to our setup and added more specific snippets. [Here's](https://github.com/asux/sublime-capybara-snippets) a link to the original repo. Thanks very much.
